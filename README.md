# Universal TypeScript boilerplate

## Installation

* `npm install`

## Serve

* `npm start` to build your client app and start a web server
* `npm run build` to prepare a distributable bundle

## Development
* run `npm start` and `npm run watch` in two separate terminals to build your client app, start a web server, and allow file changes to update in realtime

## Watch files
* `npm run watch` to build your client app and start a web server

## React
React is not installed by default. If you would like to use react, react-dom, react-router v4 and mobx use run the following command.

```sh
npm run install:react
```

NOTE: TSX and decorators are already enabled by default even without running `npm run install:react`.
